# Exercise 2.2 Square root of sum

Write a program that reads two integers from the user and prints the square root of the sum of these integers. The program does not need to work with negative values.

You can calculate the square root of an integer with the command `np.sqrt` like this:

```python
import numpy as np
number = 42
square_root = np.sqrt(number)
print(square_root)
```

Here are a few examples:
